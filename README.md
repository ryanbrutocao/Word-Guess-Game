# Word-Guess-Game
word guess game for homework#3

This was by far my most difficuly homework in the class. It was my first attempt ever building an application, as well as my very first time ever writing in javascript. The most difficult part was getting the correctly guessed letters to replace dashes on the screen. I resolved this by using arrays and index positions to push the correct letter if it matched the user guess.
